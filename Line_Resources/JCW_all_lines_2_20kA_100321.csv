# line table created 10-03-21 from NIST database
# elements h-zn I-II included for wavelength range 2000-20000 angstrom. Energy units in ev. Only lines with trans prob. All level information. No uncertainties. 
#Data c+p from NIST as tab-delim. No JS, no spaces in values 
# note that headers changed from ritz_wl_air to obs_wl_air for compatability with existing code, removed units from headers too
# read in as dataframe by pandas, with delim tab, index col false and comment char #
#strings stripped from ei and ek in pandas eg line_table['Ek(eV)']=line_table['Ek(eV)'].str.replace('[^\d.]', '').astype(float)
